# Terraform Introduction

## Overview

Welcome to the Terraform Introduction! This document provides an overview of Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.

Terraform allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, you can treat your infrastructure in a manner similar to how you manage your application code.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Configuration:** Terraform uses a declarative approach, where you define the desired state of your infrastructure rather than writing imperative scripts.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Infrastructure is defined using code, making it version-controlled, repeatable, and easily auditable.
- **State Management:** Terraform maintains a state file that records the actual infrastructure resources being managed. This enables Terraform to understand changes over time.
- **Execution Plans:** The `terraform plan` command generates an execution plan showing what changes Terraform will make before actually applying them with `terraform apply`.
- **Resource Providers:** Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers, making it possible to manage resources across multiple cloud platforms
## Getting Started

1. Install Terraform by following the instructions in the [official Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/index.html).
2. Create a new directory for your Terraform project and navigate to it in your terminal.
3. Initialize your project by running `terraform init` in your project directory.
4. Define your infrastructure configurations in `.tf` files using the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
5. Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan for your changes.
6. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes to your infrastructure.
7. Make use of Terraform's features, such as modules, to create reusable and scalable configurations.


## Stages of Terraform Workflow

Terraform follows a structured workflow involving several stages to effectively manage infrastructure as code:

1. **Initialization (`terraform init`):**
   - Initializes the working directory and downloads required plugins and modules.

2. **Planning (`terraform plan`):**
   - Generates an execution plan describing changes Terraform will apply.

3. **Validation (`terraform validate`):**
   - Validates configuration files for syntax and formatting errors.

4. **Execution (`terraform apply`):**
   - Applies changes to create, update, or delete resources.

5. **Destruction (`terraform destroy`):**
   - Destroys resources defined in the configuration to deprovision infrastructure.
